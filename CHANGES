 0.1  first version, only one function umpu.binom

      To Do: Need analogous functions for Poisson and exponential
      family generated by the hypergeometric (used for comparing
      independent binomials).  Might be nice to have analogous
      functions for UMP.

 0.2  changes to inst/doc/design.* only.

 0.3  added function arpv.binom because umpu.binom isn't helpful
      for getting the density of the abstract randomized P-value

      found and fixed a lot of problems caused by inexactness of
      computer arithmetic

 0.4  added function fci.binom to plot fuzzy confidence intervals

 0.5  clean up for CRAN

 0.5-1  ?????

 0.5-2  remove some files from package that cause annoying warnings.

        also changed code in arpv.binom.R to deal with inexact
        computer arithmetic slightly better and eliminate some
        warnings 2.6.0 gave on old code in the tests

        put in NAMESPACE (wasn't using namespaces before)

 0.5-3  switch licence to "MIT + file LICENCE" as per instructions from
            Brian Ripley
        out of monotone, into git, onto github

 0.5-4  move vignette to vignettes directory, fix file LICENSE as per
            CRAN instructions
