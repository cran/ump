 0.1  first version, only one function umpu.binom

      To Do: Need analogous functions for Poisson and exponential
      family generated by the hypergeometric (used for comparing
      independent binomials).  Might be nice to have analogous
      functions for UMP.

 0.2  changes to inst/doc/design.* only.

 0.3  added function arpv.binom because umpu.binom isn't helpful
      for getting the density of the abstract randomized P-value

      found and fixed a lot of problems caused by inexactness of
      computer arithmetic

 0.4  added function fci.binom to plot fuzzy confidence intervals

 0.5  clean up for CRAN
